# Emotional Appeal

It’s important to make sure the judge cares about you. If they’re not paying attention, they’re not absorbing your points, and your effort is all lost no matter how good your logic is. Some people will even describe debaters as bipolar, as they switch back and forth between soft, sentimental tones and harsh, passionate ones. This keeps the judge's attention and ensures that their perspective on the round will be colored by the emotion delivered in the speech.

**Drill**

This is a two-person drill. One person delivers a speech (preferably a pre-written one) while the other uses their hand to indicate how passionately/quickly the speaker should speak. The speaker should change their delivery based on the levels that the speaker wants.
