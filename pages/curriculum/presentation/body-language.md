# Body Language

Body language is essential for good performance in presentation.  When you speak, radiate a calm and assertive authority.  This manifests in several ways:
* Plant your feet.  Stand up straight.
* Use broad, slow, movements-- especially ones that open your body up. Spreading yourself wider with your arms makes people perceive you as more open and friendly.
* Hold your hands in front of you and gesticulate to emphasize.
* **Look** at the judge more than your paper and certainly more than the opponents. They're the ones who are giving you a score, not the other team.
  * The hidden weapon of gesticulations are connecting your pointer finger and your thumb.  You are perceived as more intelligent and powerful.  Look at Obama and other political leaders.  Trump is well known for this now, but early in his campaign (before his body language coaches got to him) he pointed nonstop.
  * Don't just use the same movements over and over again, judges will notice. Vary your motions and don't overdo them either-- you aren't in a slapstick routine.
