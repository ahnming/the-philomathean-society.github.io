# Body Language

Body language is essential for good performance in presentation.  When you speak, radiate a calm and assertive authority.  This manifests in several ways:
* Plant your feet.  Stand up straight.
* Use broad, slow, movements.  
* Hold your hands in front of you and gesticulate to emphasize.
  * The hidden weapon of gesticulations are connecting your pointer finger and your thumb.  You are perceived as more intelligent and powerful.  Look at Obama and other political leaders.  Trump is well known for this now, but early in his campaign (before his body language coaches got to him) he pointed nonstop.
