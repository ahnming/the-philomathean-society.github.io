# Fluency

Fluency is how easily and articulately one can express themselves. You need to be able to confidently deliver your speeches at the podium without stumbling over your words.

**Drills**

* Deliver a speech (preferably a pre-written one) and insert the word ‘and’ after every word. This drill is designed to force the speaker to pay attention to every word in the speech.
* Try to deliver a speech with a pen in your mouth. This forces the speaker to over-enunciate every word in the speech.
