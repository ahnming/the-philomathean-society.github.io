# Clarity

The judge has to be able to understand what you are saying. Many people who are not comfortable with public speaking will have the tendency to slur their speech or mumble their words. Some will speed up to a pace that is both uncomfortable for the judge and the speaker, which will lead to stammering and filler words. Oftentimes this is caused by anxiety or fear of speaking, drawn from lack of experience. Constantly practicing to speak off the cuff and performing debate rounds will help you get over this anxiety. These drills will also help improve articulation.

**Drills**

* Deliver a speech as fast as possible with a pen/pencil/other writing utensil in your mouth without losing clarity.
* Give a speech in Pig Latin.
