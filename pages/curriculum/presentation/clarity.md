The judge has to be able to understand what you are saying. Many people who are not comfortable with public speaking will have the tendency to slur their speech or mumble their words. These drills help improve articulation.

**Drills**

* Deliver a speech as fast as possible with a pen/pencil/other writing utensil in your mouth without losing clarity.
* Give a speech in Pig Latin.
