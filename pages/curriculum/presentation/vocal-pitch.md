# Vocal Pitch

Pitch is the frequency of a sound.  Varying pitch is essential for emphasis and intrigue.  In general: people listen to deeper pitches more than that of higher pitches.  As such, talk generally in a lower pitch and then emphasize with higher tones.  Finish sentences on a downward trend.

* Slide your voice from the lowest pitch you can go (feel it coming from your chest) to the highest pitch you can go (feel it coming from high in your head ).
* Make a continual tone and vary its pitch and volume, go way high up and way down.  You can use this as a warmup too!  Move your mouth (look like youâ€™re swishing mouthwash) around and feel how it impacts the sound.
  * Try tapping yourself (stomach, chest, shoulder, arm) and see how the it varies.
