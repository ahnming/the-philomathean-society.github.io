# Case Construction

To build your case, you and your partner should come up with **three** points.

For each point, you should come up with a tag line, or short name for it so that you can easily reference the point.

To fill out each point, us this acronym: **ARESI**

**A**rgument: Clearly state what the contention is.

**R**easoning: Why this contention?

**E**vidence: Reference evidence that supports the contention.

[**S**ignificance](/case-construction/significance.md): What is the significance of the contention?

**I**mpact: What is the impact?
