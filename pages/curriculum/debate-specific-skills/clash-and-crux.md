# Clash and Crux

**Clash**

Points of divergence. It’s important to identify where you and your opponent disagree because the debate should (ideally) be a comparison between the world that your opponent is proposing and the world that you are proposing. By highlighting differences between the two, it’s easier for the judge to understand why your world is a lot better than theirs.

**Crux**

After you think about the most important points of disagreement in the debate, you should think about how all of these disagreements are related and unite them under a common principle or big picture idea that the judge can use to decide the debate. For example, if most of your points of disagreement have to do with conflicts between privacy between security, your crux should focus on why the judge should prefer one principle over the other.
