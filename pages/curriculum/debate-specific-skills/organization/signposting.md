# Signposting

Signposting is a road map of where you go in your speech. It is very important. It keeps the judge on track with what you are staying and helps you stay more organized. It means you tell the judge everything you are going to do before you do it. For instance, at the beginning of the minister of the crown’s speech they say, “I will begin by rebutting the points just brought up by Side Opposition. I will then move on to reconstruct Side Government’s first two points. Finally I will construct Side Government’s third and final contention”. Then before they do each thing they say, “I will now rebut Side Oppositions first point that (such and such)”. After rebutting the point they say “I will now rebut Side Opposition’s second point”, and so on throughout their speech. Each speaker does this for whichever side they are on. It may seem tedious but you need to do it.
