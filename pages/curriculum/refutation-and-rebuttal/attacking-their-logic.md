# Attacking Their Logic

Every argument relies on a lot of hidden (and obvious) assumptions to get to the final conclusion. Identify the premises of each argument and determine whether they are valid or invalid. Think of these premises like dominos â€“ you only have to knock one over in order to take the entire argument down.

Impact Explanations: Try and convince us why each of the following impacts is the worst possible thing in the world. Write out the argument you are making in a way that maps each step you take towards the conclusion. The goal is to focus on creating a logical chain to the conclusion, and to practice not making major claims without the reasoning to back them up. Afterwards, try to knock down the arguments you just constructed. Here are some topic ideas:

* Floods

* Sexism
