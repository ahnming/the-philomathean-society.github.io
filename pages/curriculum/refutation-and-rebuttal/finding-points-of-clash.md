# Finding Points of Clash

In order to effectively attack your opponent's points, you need to identify areas in which your arguments "clash" head-on with your opponent's. During your refutation, you need to find these points of clash and explain why your contention is stronger. The judge has to choose between your argument or your opponent's, and you want to make sure that they can clearly weigh the round's contentions.

**Example**

<center><b>Your contentions</b>: marijuana is detrimental to health, expensive, and gateway drug.
<br><b>Theirs</b>: marijuana is affordable, does not cause addiction, and has no proven harms.
<br><b>Points of clash</b>: affordability, potential for future harm, and health effects.</center>

**Drills**

* Make a case for both sides, then match up the contentions based on which ones disagree the most with each other.
* Think of a phenomenon. Explain why their reason for that phenomenon is wrong, and then provide an alternative reason than the one they provided. Practice this drill whenever you brainstorm case arguments.
  * Let’s take apart an argument: Foreign aid fails because of corruption in recipient nations. The claim is that foreign aid is ineffective, and the warrant is that corruption prevents the aid from reaching the intended population. Through the warrant we’ve identified the reasoning. To defeat their reasoning, think of alternative factors influencing aid: a lot of foreign aid is channeled through NGOs and grassroots movements. The presence of alternative means of aid takes out the initial warrant AND  provides a more complete view of the world that shows that foreign aid is proactively good.
