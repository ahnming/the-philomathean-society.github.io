# Contentions

Each contention (or argument) has three parts:

* **Claim**--what you are trying to prove

* **Warrant**--the reasoning behind your claim

* **Impact**--why your claim matters
  * Impacts can be both small and large, but the general idea of an impact is that it connects the claim that an argument is making with its greater significance.

**Example**

<center>School uniforms are good for student productivity because students are more likely to have higher levels of concentration if they arenâ€™t distracted by their clothing.</center>

The **claim** is that school uniforms are good for student productivity, and the **warrant** (or reasoning) is that students will benefit from higher levels of concentration if we decrease any distractions. What about the impact? The **impact** of higher student productivity could be that students get better grades, or benefit from a better learning environment overall.


**Drill**

Write a bunch of silly claims, warrants, and impacts, mix them up, and put them together in combinations that make sense.
