# Significance

An argument's impact often has a variety of implications. Be sure to drive home all of the ways the resolution would affect the world.

The acronym **SPERM** describes five of the categories a resolution's effect could fall under:

**S**ocial

**P**olitical

**E**conomic

**R**eligious

**M**oral

**Drill**

Write as many contentions for a resolution as possible, then for each impact, list out the types of implications it would fall into.
