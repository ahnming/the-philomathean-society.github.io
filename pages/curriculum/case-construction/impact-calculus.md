# Impact Calculus

Near the end of the round both you and your opponents will probably have several impacts. In order to win the debate, you need to show why your impacts are more important your opponent's. You do this through a process called **impact calculus**. Here are five metrics you can use to determine an impact's strength or importance:
* **Probability** - how likely it is for your impact to happen. Ex: global warming is more likely than nuclear war
* **Magnitude** - how bad your impact is. Ex: a person dying is worse than a personâ€™s income decreasing
* **Scope** - How many people/things does your impact affect. Ex: A world war may affect more people than gang violence in one city
* **Urgency**  - How soon your impact is going to happen and/or whether other things can stop it from happening. Ex: global warming will take a long time to happen while economic collapse can happen quickly
* **Reversibility** - Once your impact happens is there any hope for the world? Ex: One cannot reverse the effects of extinction but one can reverse the effects of an economic decline

**Drill**

Compare the following pairs of competing impacts. Pick one of each pair and show why it is worse than its companion impact. Then show why the reverse comparison is true.

* Economic growth vs. environmental degradation
* Warfare vs. poverty
* Individual rights vs. social welfare
* Earthquakes vs. flooding
* Nuclear proliferation vs. biological weapons proliferation
