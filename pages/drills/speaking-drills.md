# Speaking Drills

**Fluency**
* Distraction Drill: Give a redo of a speech and have people distract you during it. Restart if you stumble. Best suited for non-constructive speeches
* And And And: Insert the word ‘and’ after every word. May be the best for speeches.

**Clarity**
* Over-enunciate: Give a speech at half speed and open your mouth wide to slowly say each word in an exaggerated fashion.
* Pen in mouth: Speak as fast as possible with a pen/pencil/other writing utensil in your mouth without losing clarity.
* Tongue twisters: Fairly straightforward.

**Word Economy**
* Removing filler words: Have a partner listen to you give a non-scripted speech and write down any filler/inefficient words (“like,” “is going to,” “um,” etc.). Then, decide on your three worst problems and give the speech again. Your partner should listen for these words and have you start over every time you use them. Continue until you get through the entire speech. {Like So App}
* Video/record yourself: self-explanatory
* Triple Speak: pick three random words and connect them into a coherent speech.
